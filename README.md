Procedural generation of islands as a 3d mesh (in Unity).
It uses [Unity-Voronoi](https://github.com/jesta88/Unity-Voronoi).

Loosely based on the methods described at "[Fantasy maps for fun and glory](https://azgaar.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/coastline/)" and "[Polygonal Map Generation for Games](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/
)".
